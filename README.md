pong-clone
==========

Clone of the classic Pong game made with the Unity game engine. 

The purpose of this project is to learn about game development and related technologies, using Unity as a game engine and coding in C#. The game is 2D, so it is projected onto the Z plane and resembles somewhat the classic Pong graphics.

Tools I'm using:
 * Unity (Captain Obvious says hi)
 * MS Visual Studio Express 2012 (for the C# stuff, I'll explain later)
 * Blender 

The reason I'm using Visual Studio instead of the integrated MonoDevelop is a nasty bug in GTK (which MonoDevelop uses), which makes the keys for single/double quotes unusable and the process of coding a nightmare. Until this thing is fixed, I'll stay with the MS offering. For more information: https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3230

This game is freely based on two Youtube videos about a Unity Pong tutorial, which were used as a starting point:
 * Unity3D Pong Tutorial Series - Part 1 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IzbNanA1Vk
 * Unity3D Pong Tutorial Series - Part 2 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ32rGOSg7E
 
Tested at Windows, Linux, Android and the Web player (htpp://baraujo.net/pong)

So, that's it. The game is MIT licensed, so you can do whatever you like.
